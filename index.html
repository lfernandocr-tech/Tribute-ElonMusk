      Elon Reeve Musk FRS (/ˈiːlɒn/ EE-lon; born June 28, 1971) is a business
      magnate, industrial designer, and engineer.[3] He is the founder, CEO,
      CTO, and chief designer of SpaceX; early stage investor,[b] CEO, and
      product architect of Tesla, Inc.; founder of The Boring Company;
      co-founder of Neuralink; and co-founder and initial co-chairman of OpenAI.
      A centibillionaire, Musk is one of the richest people in the world. Musk
      was born to a Canadian mother and South African father and raised in
      Pretoria, South Africa. He briefly attended the University of Pretoria
      before moving to Canada aged 17 to attend Queen's University. He
      transferred to the University of Pennsylvania two years later, where he
      received dual bachelor's degrees in economics and physics. He moved to
      California in 1995 to attend Stanford University but decided instead to
      pursue a business career, co-founding the web software company Zip2 with
      his brother Kimbal. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in
      1999. Musk co-founded online bank X.com that same year, which merged with
      Confinity in 2000 to form the company PayPal and was subsequently bought
      by eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion.
